## Take note
- my genmon id in `gtk.css` will be different from yours. To check its id, open `panel preferences > items` and hover over the spotify genmon
- the `ascii.txt` inside `.config/neofetch` uses terminal color 6 which is purple for me. Change it as you like 
- My wallpapers are 1920 x1080 and mostly fromm [wallhaven](https://wallhaven.cc)

## Panels 
Set your own panel bg colors (dont set panel bacnground color in  `gtk.css` unless you want all panels to have the same bg color)

my colors are <br>
#150729 ,opacity: 93<br>
#021826, opacity: 93
